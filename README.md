## THIS IS FOR MY FUTURE SELF TO NEVER FORGET THE STRUGGLE AND TO THE FUTURE FLUTTER LEARNERS WHO MIGHT NEED TO LEARN HOW TO GET STARTED WITH FLUTTER PROVIDER AND USE IN A PRODUCTION CODEBASE WITHIN MINUTES


At the point of creating this folder(2021, Friday, September 24, 12pm),am broke as fuck,depressed as shit,deperate as hell, i have 4 task on my throat, that must be completed this weekend(today being the point of creation is friday :) ...) 1 flutter gig, 2 flutter interview assestment, 1 nodejs bootcamp task. 

At this point, learning how to use provider pattern became inevitable, cause coincidentally the 3 flutter task required i make use of flutter provider pattern
